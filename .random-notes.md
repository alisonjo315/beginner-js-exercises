# js basics -- random notes

"emmet" extension/abbreviation, magics a simple HTML file:
vscode > type "!" then "tab"


### variable declarations
var thing = 'alison';
let age = 90;
const cool = true;
    var and let can be updated -- just don't use the (what I'm calling) prefix if you update it. For example, later in my script I could do:
    var thing = 'alison jo';
    I would not do:
    var thing = 'alison jo';
    (it might "work" but it's bad)

    const can't be changed -- the following line would throw an error:
    cool = false;



strict mode: brief explanation is simply that it forces some best practices
    not worrying about it, b/c it's forced by modules and that's the modern way to do JS so, effectively, we'll be forced into strict mode anyway.
    In theory, enabling strict mode is putting this line at the top of your script:
    'use strict';
