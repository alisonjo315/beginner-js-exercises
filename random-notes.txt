## variables basics

### variable declarations
var thing = 'alison';
let age = 90;
const cool = true;
    var and let can be updated -- just don't use the (what I'm calling) prefix if you update it. For example, later in my script I could do:
    var thing = 'alison jo';
    I would not do:
    var thing = 'alison jo';
    (it might "work" but it's bad)

    const can't be changed -- the following line would throw an error:
    cool = false;

    let and const are new to JS as of es6 (?!)

    Wes very rarely uses var variables.
        usually he uses const
        uses let sometimes

variable names must start with letters, underscores, dollar signs
    can contain ^^ these characters, and numbers
    *no hyphens*

    TYPICALLY, you don't start variables with _ or $ because they're associated with (lowdash?) and jquery, respectively (you can, but it would be weird).

strict mode: brief explanation is simply that it forces some best practices
    not worrying about it, b/c it's forced by modules and that's the modern way to do JS so, effectively, we'll be forced into strict mode anyway.
    In theory, enabling strict mode is putting this line at the top of your script:
    'use strict';
