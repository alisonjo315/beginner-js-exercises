# js basics -- random notes

## IMPORTANT

‚ö° Remember you've got his (Wes) eslint config, so there's some stuff that'll happen automatically (and/or errors that may get thrown) that aren't native JS.

## Anyway

"emmet" extension/abbreviation, magics a simple HTML file:
vscode > type "html:5" then "enter"

random image thing -- replace "200" with a width in pixels:
https://picsum.photos/200

## MDN documentation
Example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element
Look down the left sidebar...
* ‚ö† items, stay away from (non-standard, will not work for all users)
* üóë (delete icon) items, stay away from (deprecated)
* ‚öóÔ∏è (flask icon) items, experimental - consult browser compatibility table

## variables basics

### variable declarations
var thing = 'alison';
let age = 90;
const cool = true;
    var and let can be updated -- just don't use the (what I'm calling) prefix if you update it. For example, later in my script I could do:
    var thing = 'alison jo';
    I would not do:
    var thing = 'alison jo';
    (it might "work" but it's bad)

    const can't be changed -- the following line would throw an error:
    cool = false;

    when you set a const variable, you MUST set a value -- the following line would throw a syntax error "missing = in const declaration":
    const something;

    let and const are new to JS as of es6 (?!)

    Wes very rarely uses var variables.
        usually he uses const
        uses let sometimes

variable names must start with letters, underscores, dollar signs
    can contain ^^ these characters, and numbers
    *no hyphens*

    TYPICALLY, you don't start variables with _ or $ because they're associated with (lowdash?) and jquery, respectively (you can, but it would be weird).

### data types

SNOB'N'US
    ha ha ha useless mnemonic
anyway, mostly familiar to me BUT:
    String, Number, Object, Boolean
    Null
    Undefined, Symbol

pro tip: use typeof in dev tools to inspect variables on the fly
  i.e. open the CD Demo homepage > dev tools > Console, and do:
  typeof global_slider_count
  it'll output "number"

## functions

### garbage collection
"garbage collection" is the thing where variables that only exist inside a function get cleaned-up.

### function diagram image

  (stuff I'm already familiar with, but still a really nice diagram)

### reusing variables
variables / variable names canNOT be reused in the same scope
variables / variable names CAN be reused as parameters
  ** BAD **
  function myfunction() {
    const something = 'hello';
    const something = 'world';
  }
  ** FINE **
  function myfunction1(something) {
    return `Say ${something}`;
  }
  function myfunction2(something) {
    return `I meant to tell you ${something}`;
  }

### misc

Anonymous functions -- P.S. some ppl say "don't use anonymous functions, they give you bad errors" that's because the errors used to be really awful, i.e. if you have an error inside an anonymous function, it would just say "you have an error in an anonymous function" that's it, no line number, etc. Fortunately, the errors aren't so bad anymore.

### closures

Honestly, weird, but! --
Closures are the ability for a child/inner function to access variables from a higher level scope even after these functions have been called/"closed".
  The example that clicked for me the best was the hockeyGame() thing in closures.html.

## debugging

console.table(listOfObjects);
^^ use this console method for getting a list of objects!

console.group to group console log things together

console.dir is pretty similar to console.log (so far with the examples I've tried, the output is the same in FF, slightly different in Chrome)

inspector: if you select a page element, then go to Console, you can use "$0" and it'll be the thing you inspected.  ($0 is the "last element you clicked")

network: this tab in dev tools is about ...network requests! api calls and such.

from mini-workshop with Irina N:
  sources > right sidebar > event listener breakpoints > "click" (tried out on cwd_events)

  if there's ajax, you'll see "XHR/fetch Breakpoints" available

## scope

curly braces make a "block" -- it's not just functions, block scope exists even with just conditionals!

## DOM and stuff

window - we know that
document - we know that
navigator: higher level than the window -- essentially, it's the device (browser/OS/etc.)

### querySelector

need to get stuff from the DOM?
  use document.querySelector or document.querySelectorAll
  also item.querySelector where "item" is an object inside document you've already grabbed from the DOM.

  (yes rather than document get elemet by id or whatever)

### dataset (data-*)
add data-* attributes to objects, for example:
  <img data-name="kait" src="/path/to/image.png" />
then you can access those "data" attributes via "dataset" object (see the-dom.js for examples)
‚≠ê‚≠ê YES like data-* attributes on inline embedded stuff in Drupal rich text fields!

### node
A "node" is an element or a bit of text.

### append / appendChild
append might be fine to use at this point, instead of appendChild
    (append wasn't supported by IE, but IE is super dead now)
    (he didn't cover append in this course, b/c IE was still kicking around at that point)

## misc eslint

### disabling/enabling within a file

See examples in...
- some.js "eslint-disable-next-line"
- types_*.js files "eslint-disable" at top to disable eslint entirely for each of these files
- types_strings.js "eslint-enable" near the end (commented out, actually) (not sure if there's an "eslint-enable-next-line", haven't tried)
- variables.html "eslint-disable prefer-const" example for "entire file" (so to speak)

## misc

strict mode: brief explanation is simply that it forces some best practices
    not worrying about it, b/c it's forced by modules and that's the modern way to do JS so, effectively, we'll be forced into strict mode anyway.
    In theory, enabling strict mode is putting this line at the top of your script:
    'use strict';

you can pass multiple things to console.log, it'll just dump everything out:
  console.log("thing 1", "thing 2");
  outputs:
    thing 1 thing 2

"unreachable" notice/error happens, for example, when something is put after a "return" in a function. i.e.
  function inchToCm(inches) {
    const cm = inches * 2.54;
    return cm;
    const text = 'hello world';
    return inches * 2.54;
  }
  ^^ everything after "return cm" is "unreachable"
